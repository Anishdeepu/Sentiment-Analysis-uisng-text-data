student only when I didn't expect it at all, namely at the á
beginning of September."
fear,"In the real sense of the word I experienced fear in my first á
months in the army. During my first night of duty. The cause for á
all this was a bear. I became panic sticken (may be for the first á
time) and even forgot that I had a gun."

didn't want to face or tell my other flatmates, or family."

loudly and threatened that with ""connections"" she will expel me á

general impression from severl situations which evoked this á
feeling in me."

of mine asked me to give him my lecture notes (I had very good á

out that there was no audience at all because everyone had á

intelligent people, warned me I had to move in the nearest á
future. But I had difficulties in moving my luggage because I á

luggage was well packed and did not stand in their way. I was á
quite  disappointed and disgusted."
shame,"During our last exarcise in agricultural machines we went out in á

Council."

to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was á
only ""the thing to do"", and not really an act of love."
guilt,"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I á
(being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in á

birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along á

guilt,"I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole á
week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers á
thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to á

given me."

was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I á
thought about what had happened."

person. There were other cousins she could have asked but she á
asked me."

days after."

I only knew the child and had not come into contact with either á

felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the á
person concerned, as I felt the situation volitile, did this á
without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as á
she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it gossip I á

NOW I would not have done it."

from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the á
time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. She said a á

not."

of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to á

would enjoy mixing with younger people, also financial á

days nothing had been done.  I felt disgusted at the whole á
situation."

mirror.  My back looked unpresentable and I felt ashamed at my á

had been judged by eminent judges and political scientists."
fear,"Fear is an emotion that I experience very often.  Naturally this á
is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.  á
However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.  á
This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student á
lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened á
to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about á
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing á
me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really á
paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh."
anger,"I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most á
angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.  á
It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in á
class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I á
had a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my á
parents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked."
sadness,"I have once been very sad and lonely.  This was when I was trying á
to organize a play as a student (15 years).  Instead of á
materializing, it fizzled out.  The worst thing was that the play á
fell apart completely and I found myself weeping uncontrollably.  á
Now when I think of it, I laugh it off; but at that time it was á
intense."
disgust,"This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life á
in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three á
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were á
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets á
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to á
myself -""what is life?"".  It is one hell of a place where á
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of á
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about á
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and á
dejected."
shame,"This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good á
mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor á
to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a á
very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this á
class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got á
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the á
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was á
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but á
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I á
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her á
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw á
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through  á
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the á
fact that she gave me a character certificate. "
guilt,[ No response.]
joy,"This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood á
first in the university for the M.A exams.  A few days before the á

unofficially.  So I had been expecting the results but the á
confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my á
success. á
"
fear,"This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus, á
by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit á
outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as á
to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was á
terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.  I reported á
him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.  á
I was even more petrified then."
anger,"A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came á
to do it was very rude to my mother and me.  I rushed to thhe á

to him.  The mechanic was asked to apologize."
sadness,"The day I was to receive my gold-medal for the M.A, my á
grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness.  She  á
died a few hours before the convocation.  While I was á
attending the convocation I had to control my grief as she would á
not have liked me to miss it.  It was a day she had been waiting á
for, but did not get to see. "
disgust,"We had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)    á
staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started á
passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was á
brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was á
herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks á
made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly á
remember this incident as she knew that I had not encouraged the  á
guy."
shame,"I was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in á
teaching girls judo at a suburban college.  I was just a beginer, á
and he made me a green belt so that I would be able to command á
respect.  This was against my principles, and yet I allowed myself á
to listen to him.  I gave it up soon after, however I felt very á
ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my á
foot down earlier."
guilt,"I was coming back home with my mother when the purse I was á
carrying got stolen.  It was done so swifty that I did not á
realize what had happened till much later.  A lot of money and the á
keys of the house were lost.  I was guilt ridden at my á
carelessness.  I felt terrible as I do not normally loose things á
and this was quite important, especially the keys.á

against him, in the meanwhile people intervened."

unfortunately he failed to get admission.  We had done our graduation á

as we had expected it to and this saddened me."
disgust,"My classmate at TISS has the habit of biting his nails and ever á

he should stop biting his nails.  However he found it difficult á

started introducing ourselves.  Two of the boys showed a lot of á

sitting next to me as I was afraid that they would ask me á
questions on those activities."

time went by my fear grew."

horror film shown on T.V."

anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  á
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not á
pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others á
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two á
hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and á

the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the á

the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The á
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."

feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious  á
all night."
anger,"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had á
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very á

so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."

I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she á
died."

(I can not remember what the problem was).  He continously tried á
to make me talk to him and disturbed me."
shame,"One day, when I was sitting on the bus, there was an old woman á
standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not á
think of giving her my seat.  A 50 year old woman who was sitting á
beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,  á

person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood á
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"

is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
disgust,When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.
shame,"When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt á

another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and á
attitudes.  I was very angry."

us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who á
put up his hand and this surprised the whole class."

pointed out our misbehaviour."

been admitted to the university."

ahead of me."
anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
sadness,"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within á
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not á
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried á
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two á
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as á
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in á
suffernig , even die instead of her."
disgust,"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later á
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they á

G.P.A was very low."

this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me."
joy,"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had á
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the á
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having á
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to á
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me á
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would á
look very nice if we wore them together."
fear,"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I á

for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would  á
not be able to finish it."

have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and á
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would á
understand this as they had always done).  They did not á
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many á
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
disgust,"When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting á
next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were á
disturbing others."
shame,"During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I á

things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I á

representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic á
was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then. á
Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for á
the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that á
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as á
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class á
representative that I was not going but he did not know the á
reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked á
me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone á
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in á
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me á
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind á
afterwards."
joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was á

fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would á
die."

in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and á

classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she á

others had guessed what had happened."
guilt,"One night,when I was in primary 5 or 6, I felt thirsty so I á

community and so I had many opportunities to contact the á
government and the committee members of the district board (a á
local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and á

decided to work as community leaders."

It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á

Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides á
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk á

another classmate."

interview the general public.  One of my friends in the group á
lost her purse and she was very nervous.  Five of us had to go á

had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any á
thing about it. "
guilt,"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me á
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual á

coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put á
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I á
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the á
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins á
were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying á
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not á
understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me á
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just á
to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few á
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first á
time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him á
scolding me and I felt disgusted."

assigned one person in each group to make a presentation.  The á

guilt,"Once I quarrelled with my sister and after this I deliberately á
messed up her belongings."

houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have á
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen á
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on á

plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat á
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."

shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on á
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
anger,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that á
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's á
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so á
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á
I was in a bad mood then)."
sadness,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good á
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them á
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind á
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made á
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was á
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
disgust,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like á
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help á
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away á
from him as soon as possible."

for two months.  Yesterday I was chatting with my teacher and á
when we talked of the Summer job, I felt ashamed."

succeeded.  However a year later I got the bad habit again.  I felt  á
useless as I always found excuses to explain my behaviour.  As a result I á
felt guilty."

friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my á
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had á
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the á
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was á
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all á
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the á
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my á
studies. á
"
fear,"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes á
outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would á
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and á
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet á
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very á
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
anger,"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the á

people and they saw me, so I felt ashamesd.  Moreover I hurt my á
ankle and it was painful."
guilt,"One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my  á
parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I  á
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children  á
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and  á
this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was  á
still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen  á
to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
joy,"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the á
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very á

antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very á

uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him á
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence á
because of traditional moral values.  "

was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I á
getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not á
expect too much from going to the university."

sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know  á
what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around  á
as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered ""You  á
have forgotten to zip up your trousers.""  I was at a loss to say anything  á
and I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt  á
even more ashamed."
guilt,"At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.  á
During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and á
talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also á
another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people á
had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him. á
 Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling á
books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I á
told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the á
books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not á

me to study by myself first but I did not do it.  When he asked me á
 if I had studied, I felt very ashamed. "
guilt,"I escaped from communicating with God for a long time.  I did not á
read the scriptures and I did not pray.  I felt that I was á
getting further and further away from God.  I felt guilty as this á
was because of my laziness."

cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have  á
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad  á
impression of me."

afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was á
not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
anger,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á
say anything but just watched me leave."
sadness,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before á
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I á

fear,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I á
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my á
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue á
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
anger,"The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á
grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á
made me angry."

and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives á
and my tears made me sad."
disgust,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid á
doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch á
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had á
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime á
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize á
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a á
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He á
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him á
and did not want to keep any contact with him."

his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.  á
Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I á
felt ashamed at having misunderstood him."

person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time á
to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care á

own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty."

C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had á

 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was á
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very á
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost á
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
sadness,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
disgust,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had á
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played á
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell á
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right á
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to á
leave the room and go somewhere else."
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was á
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had á
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female á
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not á
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I á
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I á
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."
guilt,I lied to one of my best friends.
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a á
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I á
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
anger,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á
child to teach."
sadness,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á
would think that I had not prepared for it."
disgust,"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the á
door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit á
and bring the germs in the house."
shame,"I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I á
was scolded immediately."
guilt,"I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when á
I called out loudly."
